## Context

### Communication Flow Analysis

#### FluentBit, Log Agent:
* Ingress: Metric scraping (self-monitoring and RMA) and health checks
* Egress: Kubernetes API, DNS, external logging services (for example, CLS)

#### Log, Trace, Metric Gateway:
* Ingress: Metric scraping (self-monitoring and RMA), health checks, OTLP data ingested from customer workloads
* Egress: Kubernetes API, DNS, external telemetry backends (for example, CLS or Dynatrace)

#### Metric Agent:
* Ingress: Metric scraping (self-monitoring and RMA), health checks
* Egress: Kubernetes API, DNS, Kubelet, scraping customer workloads metrics, external telemetry backends (for example, CLS or Dynatrace)

#### Self-Monitor:
* Ingress: Metric scraping (RMA), health checks, alert queries
* Egress: Kubernetes API, DNS, scraping module components metrics

#### Telemetry Manager:
* Ingress: Metric scraping (RMA), health checks, alertmanager webhook, admission and conversion webhooks
* Egress: Kubernetes API, DNS, self-monitor alert queries

## Decision

The current network policies are too weak. They do not meet the requirements described in https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/18818. These policies allow all IP addresses for both incoming and outgoing traffic. They only limit ports for incoming traffic, which means they can be made stronger. However, we will still need to allow any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) in some cases for incoming and outgoing rules. External services like CLS and Dynatrace, as well as Kube API server, use different IP address ranges that we cannot predict. This makes it hard to restrict outgoing traffic by IP address. Instead, we will restrict outgoing traffic by port number.

We also decided to use the label selector `networking.kyma-project.io/metrics-scraping: allowed` not only for RMA, but also for metric agent, self-monitoring, and customer-managed Prometheus deployments. Gardener system Pods cannot be labeled in the zero-trust mode, so these Pods must be excluded from scraping.

# Phase 1: Hardening Existing Network Policies

- Rename existing network policies to follow new naming conventions: `kyma-project.io--telemetry-<network-policy-name>`
- Remove health check ports from ingress rules because they have no impact.
- Implement cross-component network policies to allow essential services like DNS and Kubernetes API access.
- Harden telemetry manager and self-monitoring because it requires no breaking changes.
- Separate self-monitoring webhook from admission webhooks in telemetry manager to allow more fine-grained ingress rules.

# Phase 2: Introduce Zero-Trust Network Policies

- Exclude Gardener system Pods from scraping jobs. Our metric agent's Prometheus receiver discovers and attempts to scrape Gardener system Pods because they have standard Prometheus annotations. However, in zero-trust mode, the agent can only scrape Pods with the label `networking.kyma-project.io/metrics-scraping: allowed`. Because we cannot apply this label to Gardener-managed Pods, the scraping attempts fail. To prevent these failures, the scraping configuration must explicitly exclude Gardener system Pods.
- Introduce a new label `networking.kyma-project.io/telemetry-otlp: allowed` for customer workloads that send OTLP data to Telemetry gateways. Network policies use this label to allow incoming traffic from customer workloads to Telemetry gateways on OTLP ports (4318, 4317).
- Implement a feature toggle in the Telemetry CR to enable or disable the stricter network policy rules. These rules harden communication for customer-to-telemetry, RMA, and cross-Kyma modules. Although the name **networkPoliciesEnabled** is not perfectly accurate because basic policies always exist, we use it to maintain consistency with other Kyma modules. 
- Document the required Pod labels for customer workloads to ensure proper communication with telemetry components.


### Proposed Network Policy Changes for Phase 2

Phase 1 implements the cross-component policies. Phase 2 focuses on introducing zero-trust policies for customer-to-telemetry, RMA, and cross-Kyma module communication.

#### Component-specific Policies

This phase restricts all component egress traffic by port number. Previously, we allowed all egress traffic on any port. The highlighted text in the following sections indicates the new rules that further restrict egress traffic.

Egress rules for the following components are restricted to only the ports used to connect to customer backends. A utility function in `metricpipelineutils` extracts customer backend ports.
